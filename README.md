# THIS PROJECT IS NOW OBSOLETE
It has been superseded by Centrifuge and the Distance Game Support Library (GSL). Centrifuge provides a much more stable and streamlined development environment, it's easier to develop mods for (NuGet package!) and doesn't care what game it runs on! The game-specific functionality is replaced by GSLs - acting as additional SDK modules for the mods - maintained separately from Centrifuge.
