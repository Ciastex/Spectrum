# THIS PROJECT IS NOW OBSOLETE
It has been superseded by Centrifuge and the Distance Game Support Library (GSL). Centrifuge provides a much more stable and streamlined development environment, it's easier to develop mods for (NuGet package!). And doesn't care what game it runs on - the game-specific functionality is replaced by GSLs acting as additional SDK modules for the mods maintained separately from Centrifuge.
